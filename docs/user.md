# USER MANUAL FOR CASCADIA

Welcome to the user manual for our Cascadia application, here, you will learn how to launch our version of Cascadia and the correct ways to use it.

It is assumed from here that you already know the rules of Cascadia, but be warned, this is a square version, meaning the tiles are in the shape of a square instead of the usual hexagons.
Now let's get into the game !

First, you will need to be in the possession of the game data, contained in the src folder and in the lib folder but most importantly you should find in the game folder, the build.xml file, this id what you need to install the game and get everything ready to launch !
For that purpose you need to have ant installed on your computer and find yourself in the cascadia folder, then run the command ant all and all you need to do is watch as everything is created, you should see a BUILD SUCCESSFUL message once it is done, at that point a few things will have appeared in the game folder but don't worry about them as you only need the Cascadia.jar file. Run java -jar Cascadia.jar in your terminal, assuming java is installed on your device, this will launch the game and you will see a window open !

From now on all you need to know is that the graphic version is played with the mouse and the terminal version is played with your keyboard, but all instructions necessary to play are mostly present on screen. To perform an action on the graphic version simply left click on the screen, terminal version might ask more input on your keyboard but every input is cleaarly indicated right before you have a choice. And don't worry about making a mistake, if your input is not an available choice the game will simply ignore it until you give the correct input. If you wish to interrupt the program before the end of the game, simply go to the terminal running the game and press ctrl+C !

With all that in mind, you have everything you need to know to enjoy a nice Cascadia game ! 

Have fun !
